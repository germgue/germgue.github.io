			  <p><b>Stays for Every Kind of Getaway</b></p>
				
					
<p>In towns across Alaska you'll find hotels (locally owned or chain), B&Bs, cabin and/or house rentals, and what we refer to as roadside adventure lodges, which have a remote wilderness lodge feel, but are easily accessed from the road system.</p>

<p>There are also speciality lodges that focus on one activity, like bear viewing or fishing. Select a speciality lodge in the same way you'd select a town, planning to spend a few days to discover the area and the experience.</p>

<p>Finally, there are remote wilderness lodges accessible by plane or boat. Wilderness lodges offer a range of activities. Fish, search for wildlife, take a nature walk, enjoy a cooking class or evening program, and more. Above all else, these are luxury experiences. Plan to spend 2+ nights.</p>

<p>If you're camping, you can choose from RV Parks & Campgrounds or Public Use Cabins.</p>
