<b>A Dream Within a Dream</b> <br>
BY EDGAR ALLAN POE<br> 
		 </p>
<p>Take this kiss upon the brow!<br>
And, in parting from you now,<br>
Thus much let me avow —<br>
You are not wrong, who deem<br>
That my days have been a dream;<br>
Yet if hope has flown away<br>
In a night, or in a day,<br>
In a vision, or in none,<br>
Is it therefore the less gone? <br>
All that we see or seem<br>
Is but a dream within a dream.<br>
</p>
<p>I stand amid the roar<br>
Of a surf-tormented shore,<br>
And I hold within my hand<br>
Grains of the golden sand —<br>
How few! yet how they creep<br>
Through my fingers to the deep,<br>
While I weep — while I weep!<br>
O God! Can I not grasp<br>
Them with a tighter clasp?<br>
O God! can I not save<br>
One from the pitiless wave?<br>
Is all that we see or seem<br>
But a dream within a dream?<br>
