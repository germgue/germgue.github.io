<p><b>“Alone”</b><br>
BY EDGAR ALLAN POE<br>
</p>
<p>From childhood’s hour I have not been<br>
As others were—I have not seen<br>
As others saw—I could not bring<br>
My passions from a common spring—<br>
From the same source I have not taken<br>
My sorrow—I could not awaken<br>
My heart to joy at the same tone—<br>
And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—<br>
Then—in my childhood—in the dawn<br>
Of a most stormy life—was drawn<br>
From ev’ry depth of good and ill<br>
The mystery which binds me still—<br>
From the torrent, or the fountain—<br>
From the red cliff of the mountain—<br>
From the sun that ’round me roll’d<br>
In its autumn tint of gold—<br>
From the lightning in the sky<br>
As it pass’d me flying by—<br>
From the thunder, and the storm—<br>
And the cloud that took the form<br>
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br>
Of a demon in my view—<br>
